# Agent Memory & Notes

This directory tracks persistent agent context for the messages-app-mcp repository.

- `project.memory.json` – machine-readable facts: guidance version, tool availability, commands, retention policy, and recent tool provenance.
- `notes/` – (optional) human-readable artifacts, ADRs, and proof logs referenced from memory entries.

See [docs/reference/build-verify-guidance.md](../docs/reference/build-verify-guidance.md) for the workflow rules that apply to this project.
